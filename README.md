## Glossary

#### bike shed

> bikeshed +‎ -ing. The term was coined as a metaphor to illuminate Parkinson’s Law of Triviality. Parkinson observed that a committee whose job is to approve plans for a nuclear power plant may spend the majority of its time on relatively unimportant but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bikeshed, while neglecting the design of the power plant itself, which is far more important but also far more difficult to criticize constructively. It was popularized in the Berkeley Software Distribution community by Poul-Henning Kamp and has spread from there to the software industry at large.

#### meta

> pertaining to or noting an abstract, high-level analysis or commentary, especially one that consciously references something of its own type.
~ [dictionary.com](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/meta?s=t)

Generally, this means it refers to not the thing you're talking about, but the one level higher - for instance, if you're eating pancakes, a meta comment would be about the whole process of talking about eating pancakes, as opposed to talking about how good they taste. 

#### sharding

TODO

#### lossy

This [comes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression) from the world of data compression. It means that data can be lost. So, for instance, a lossy note taking would mean that not everything useful was written down.

#### DDoS

A DDoS is a distributed denial of service attack. Basically, it is way of taking down a website by sending a lot of traffic to it. "It is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door or gate to a shop or business, and not letting legitimate parties enter into the shop or business, disrupting normal operations." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack))
