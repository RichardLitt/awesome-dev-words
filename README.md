## Glossary

#### meta

> pertaining to or noting an abstract, high-level analysis or commentary, especially one that consciously references something of its own type.
~ [dictionary.com](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/meta?s=t)

Generally, this means it refers to not the thing you're talking about, but the one level higher - for instance, if you're eating pancakes, a meta comment would be about the whole process of talking about eating pancakes, as opposed to talking about how good they taste. 

#### sharding

TODO

#### lossy

This [comes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression) from the world of data compression. It means that data can be lost. So, for instance, a lossy note taking would mean that not everything useful was written down.

#### DDoS

A DDoS is a distributed denial of service attack. Basically, it is way of taking down a website by sending a lot of traffic to it. "It is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door or gate to a shop or business, and not letting legitimate parties enter into the shop or business, disrupting normal operations." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack))
